Empirically, we report model steering performance across different\nLLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the\nsource code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a\ndemonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at\nhttps://zjunlp.github.io/project/EasyEdit2/video for a quick introduction."}

However, it is often difficult to\nfind sufficient examples for all categories in a task when building a\nhigh-quality training set. In this article, I describe this problem and propose\na solution, the synthetic imputation approach. Leveraging a generative LLM\n(GPT-4o), this approach generates synthetic texts based on careful prompting\nand five original examples drawn randomly with replacement from the sample.\nThis approach ensures that new synthetic texts are sufficiently different from\nthe original texts to reduce overfitting, but retain the underlying substantive\nmeaning of the examples to maximize out-of-sample performance. With 75 original\nexamples or more, synthetic imputation's performance is on par with a full\nsample of original texts, and overfitting remains low, predictable and\ncorrectable with 50 original samples. The synthetic imputation approach\nprovides a novel role for generative LLMs in research and allows applied\nresearchers to balance their datasets for best performance."}

An\neffective response to this query should include quintessential features of an\nacademic talk, such as a compelling opening, clear research questions, and a\ntakeaway.

To address\nthis issue, we propose a fully Bayesian Topics over Time (BToT) model via the\nintroduction of a conjugate prior to the Beta distribution. This prior acts as\na regularization that prevents the online version of the algorithm from\nunstable updates when a topic is poorly represented in a mini-batch. The\ncharacteristics of this prior to the Beta distribution are studied here for the\nfirst time. Still, this model suffers from a difference in scale between the\nsingle-time observations and the multiplicity of words per document. A\nvariation of BToT, Weighted Bayesian Topics over Time (WBToT), is proposed as a\nsolution. In WBToT, publication dates are repeated a certain number of times\nper document, which balances the relative influence of words and timestamps\nalong the inference process. We have tested our models on two datasets: a\ncollection of over 200 years of US state-of-the-union (SOTU) addresses and a\nlarge-scale COVID-19 Twitter corpus of 10 million tweets. The results show that\nWBToT captures events better than Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other SOTA\ntopic models like BERTopic: the median absolute deviation of the topic presence\nover time is reduced by $51\\%$ and $34\\%$, respectively.

Among existing\npost-training quantization algorithms, the ApiQ method achieves superior\naccuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two\nideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level.\nFirst, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques\nwith ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the\nbaseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads\nto two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is\ngained through full retraining may not be feasible through partial training.\n(2) This gain seems to depend on using a large and diverse dataset in\nquantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the\ntwo insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon\nApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. It\nrelies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the\nmost impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on benchmark\nlanguage models from the LLaMA family show that our proposed approach boosts\naccuracy and tightens the gap between the quantized model and the\nfull-precision model, with minimal overhead. Our method will be made publicly\navailable to facilitate future developments in ultra-low-bit quantization of\nlarge language models."}

A recent line of work proposes\nan abstract view, called language generation in the limit, where generation is\nseen as a game between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates\nstrings from an unknown language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of\ncandidate languages, and after seeing a finite set of these strings, the\nalgorithm must generate new strings from $K$ that it has not seen before. This\nformalism highlights a key tension: the trade-off between validity (the\nalgorithm should only produce strings from the language) and breadth (it should\nbe able to produce many strings from the language). This trade-off is central\nin applied language generation as well, where it appears as a balance between\nhallucination (generating invalid utterances) and mode collapse (generating\nonly a restricted set of outputs). Despite its importance, this trade-off has\nbeen challenging to study quantitatively. We develop ways to quantify this\ntrade-off by formalizing breadth using measures of density. Existing algorithms\nfor language generation in the limit produce output sets that can have zero\ndensity in the true language, and this important failure of breadth might seem\nunavoidable. We show, however, that such a failure is not necessary: we provide\nan algorithm for language generation in the limit whose outputs have strictly\npositive density in $K$. We also study the internal representations built by\nthese algorithms, specifically the sequence of hypothesized candidate languages\nthey consider, and show that achieving the strongest form of breadth may\nrequire oscillating indefinitely between high- and low-density representations.\nOur analysis introduces a novel topology on language families, with notions of\nconvergence and limit points playing a key role."}

Significant updates and revisions to\n  arXiv:2411.09607", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of\ninformation access systems, especially with retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a barrier to\ncontinued progress, a challenge we tackle in this work by proposing an\nautomatic evaluation framework that is validated against human annotations. We\nbelieve that the nugget evaluation methodology provides a solid foundation for\nevaluating RAG systems. This approach, originally developed for the TREC\nQuestion Answering (QA) Track in 2003, evaluates systems based on atomic facts\nthat should be present in good answers. Our efforts focus on \"refactoring\" this\nmethodology, where we describe the AutoNuggetizer framework that specifically\napplies LLMs to both automatically create nuggets and automatically assign\nnuggets to system answers. In the context of the TREC 2024 RAG Track, we\ncalibrate a fully automatic approach against strategies where nuggets are\ncreated manually or semi-manually by human assessors and then assigned manually\nto system answers. Based on results from a community-wide evaluation, we\nobserve strong agreement at the run level between scores derived from fully\nautomatic nugget evaluation and human-based variants. The agreement is stronger\nwhen individual framework components such as nugget assignment are automated\nindependently. This suggests that our evaluation framework provides tradeoffs\nbetween effort and quality that can be used to guide the development of future\nRAG systems. However, further research is necessary to refine our approach,\nparticularly in establishing robust per-topic agreement to diagnose system\nfailures effectively."}

The extended multi-dimensional Hawkes process captures the\nhierarchical structure, multi-dimensional interactions, and mutual influences\nacross different topics, forming a complex propagation network. Moreover,\nrecognizing the lack of high-quality datasets capable of comprehensively\ncapturing the evolution of public opinion dynamics, we introduce a new dataset,\nVISTA.

By considering entire repositories rather than isolated\nfunctions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects\nwith dependencies across multiple files.

This allows us to cleanly and controllably\nquantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like\nreal-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our\ntasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a)\ndiscovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay,\ndrawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in\ndesigning math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and\nconceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively;\ncomparatively, multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and\ndiffusion models, excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, in\nour tasks, we find that to elicit randomness from the Transformer without\nhurting coherence, it is better to inject noise right at the input layer (via a\nmethod we dub hash-conditioning) rather than defer to temperature sampling from\nthe output layer.
