While this\nemerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant\nchallenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical\nconsiderations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based\nvideo generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical\napplications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies,\nanalyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate\napplications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and\nsuper-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased\nvideo generation and related domains, including video representation learning,\nquestion answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et\nal., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which\nfocus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis\n(Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our\nwork provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on\ndiffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics,\nindustry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation.\nThis survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners\nworking at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing\ninsights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations\nthat drive this rapidly evolving field. A structured list of related works\ninvolved in this survey is also available on\nhttps://github.com/Eyeline-Research/Survey-Video-Diffusion."}
