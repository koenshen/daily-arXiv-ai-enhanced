This paper reviews the transformative potential of Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) in addressing these limitations by integrating\ncross-modal data such as visual, spatial, and environmental inputs to enable\nholistic scene understanding. Through a comprehensive analysis of MLLM-based\napproaches, we highlight their capabilities in enhancing perception,\ndecision-making, and adversarial robustness, while also examining the role of\nkey datasets (e.g., KITTI, DRAMA, ML4RoadSafety) in advancing research.\nFurthermore, we outline future directions, including real-time edge deployment,\ncausality-driven reasoning, and human-AI collaboration. By positioning MLLMs as\na cornerstone for next-generation traffic safety systems, this review\nunderscores their potential to revolutionize the field, offering scalable,\ncontext-aware solutions that proactively mitigate risks and improve overall\nroad safety."}

As generative AI applications become\nincreasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with\nthem through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability,\nand transparency. This article examines how strategic prompt engineering can\nembed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI\ninteractions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This\narticle proposes a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering\nthat encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system\nselection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management.\nDrawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can\nbe leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential\nrisks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a\ndelicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness,\ncombining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced\nunderstanding of social impact. Through examination of real-world and emerging\npractices, the article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as\na crucial bridge between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations\nto fine-tune AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This\napproach aligns with broader \"Responsibility by Design\" principles, embedding\nethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than\ntreating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key\nresearch directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of\nresponsible prompt engineering."}

We perform a\ncomprehensive benchmarking of different zero-shot first-stage retrieval methods\non the dataset, including dense and sparse retrievers, query and document\nmachine translation, and state-of-the-art multilingual retrievers.

Sparse\nretrievers, such as BM25 or SPLADE, combined with document translation, show\ncompetitive results, providing an efficient alternative to large dense models.\nThis research advances the understanding of cross-lingual academic information\nretrieval and provides a framework that others can use to build comparable\ndatasets across different languages and disciplines.

Metaxas"], "title": "SignX: The Foundation Model for Sign Recognition", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "The complexity of sign language data processing brings many challenges. The\ncurrent approach to recognition of ASL signs aims to translate RGB sign\nlanguage videos through pose information into English-based ID glosses, which\nserve to uniquely identify ASL signs. Note that there is no shared convention\nfor assigning such glosses to ASL signs, so it is essential that the same\nglossing conventions are used for all of the data in the datasets that are\nemployed. This paper proposes SignX, a foundation model framework for sign\nrecognition. It is a concise yet powerful framework applicable to multiple\nhuman activity recognition scenarios. First, we developed a Pose2Gloss\ncomponent based on an inverse diffusion model, which contains a multi-track\npose fusion layer that unifies five of the most powerful pose information\nsources--SMPLer-X, DWPose, Mediapipe, PrimeDepth, and Sapiens\nSegmentation--into a single latent pose representation. Second, we trained a\nVideo2Pose module based on ViT that can directly convert raw video into signer\npose representation. Through this 2-stage training framework, we enable sign\nlanguage recognition models to be compatible with existing pose formats, laying\nthe foundation for the common pose estimation necessary for sign recognition.\nExperimental results show that SignX can recognize signs from sign language\nvideo, producing predicted gloss representations with greater accuracy than has\nbeen reported in prior work."}
