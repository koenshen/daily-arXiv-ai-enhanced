Among them tongue being a highly\nversatile active articulator responsible for shaping airflow to produce\ntargeted speech sounds that are intellectual, clear, and distinct. This paper\npresents a novel approach for predicting tongue and lip articulatory features\ninvolved in a given speech acoustics using a stacked Bidirectional Long\nShort-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture, combined with a one-dimensional\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for post-processing with fixed weights\ninitialization. The proposed network is trained with two datasets consisting of\nsimultaneously recorded speech and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA)\ndatasets, each introducing variations in terms of geographical origin,\nlinguistic characteristics, phonetic diversity, and recording equipment. The\nperformance of the model is assessed in Speaker Dependent (SD), Speaker\nIndependent (SI), corpus dependent (CD) and cross corpus (CC) modes.\nExperimental results indicate that the proposed model with fixed weights\napproach outperformed the adaptive weights initialization with in relatively\nminimal number of training epochs. These findings contribute to the development\nof robust and efficient models for articulatory feature prediction, paving the\nway for advancements in speech production research and applications."}

We detail the practices in\nbuilding Kimi-Audio, including model architecture, data curation, training\nrecipe, inference deployment, and evaluation. Specifically, we leverage a\n12.5Hz audio tokenizer, design a novel LLM-based architecture with continuous\nfeatures as input and discrete tokens as output, and develop a chunk-wise\nstreaming detokenizer based on flow matching. We curate a pre-training dataset\nthat consists of more than 13 million hours of audio data covering a wide range\nof modalities including speech, sound, and music, and build a pipeline to\nconstruct high-quality and diverse post-training data. Initialized from a\npre-trained LLM, Kimi-Audio is continual pre-trained on both audio and text\ndata with several carefully designed tasks, and then fine-tuned to support a\ndiverse of audio-related tasks. Extensive evaluation shows that Kimi-Audio\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of audio benchmarks including\nspeech recognition, audio understanding, audio question answering, and speech\nconversation. We release the codes, model checkpoints, as well as the\nevaluation toolkits in https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio."}
