One approach to this question is to\ncompare the cognitive dynamics of humans and large language models (LLMs).\nHowever, such a comparison requires a method to quantitatively analyze AI\ncognitive behavior under controlled conditions. While anecdotal observations\nsuggest that certain prompts can dramatically change LLM behavior, these\nobservations have remained largely qualitative. Here, we propose a two-part\nframework to investigate this phenomenon: a Transition-Inducing Prompt (TIP)\nthat triggers a rapid shift in LLM responsiveness, and a Transition Quantifying\nPrompt (TQP) that evaluates this change using a separate LLM. Through\ncontrolled experiments, we examined how LLMs react to prompts embedding two\nsemantically distant concepts (e.g., mathematical aperiodicity and traditional\ncrafts)--either fused together or presented separately--by changing their\nlinguistic quality and affective tone. Whereas humans tend to experience\nheightened engagement when such concepts are meaningfully blended producing a\nnovel concept--a form of conceptual fusion--current LLMs showed no significant\ndifference in responsiveness between semantically fused and non-fused prompts.\nThis suggests that LLMs may not yet replicate the conceptual integration\nprocesses seen in human intuition. Our method enables fine-grained,\nreproducible measurement of cognitive responsiveness, and may help illuminate\nkey differences in how intuition and conceptual leaps emerge in artificial\nversus human minds."}

The system integrates\nmemory-augmented task planning, enabling robots to execute high-level user\ncommands while tracking past actions. It employs three specialized agents: a\nrouting agent, a task planning agent, and a knowledge base agent, each powered\nby task-specific LLMs. By leveraging in-context learning, our system avoids the\nneed for explicit model training. RAG enables the system to retrieve context\nfrom past interactions, enhancing long-term object tracking. A combination of\nGrounded SAM and LLaMa3.2-Vision provides robust object detection, facilitating\nsemantic scene understanding for task planning. Evaluation across three\nhousehold scenarios demonstrates high task planning accuracy and an improvement\nin memory recall due to RAG. Specifically, Qwen2.5 yields best performance for\nspecialized agents, while LLaMA3.1 excels in routing tasks. The source code is\navailable at: https://github.com/marc1198/chat-hsr."}

We term this iterative, multi-turn\nprocess codeflow and introduce CodeFlowBench, the first benchmark designed for\ncomprehensively evaluating LLMs' ability to perform codeflow, namely to\nimplement new functionality by reusing existing functions over multiple turns.\nCodeFlowBench comprises 5258 problems drawn from Codeforces and is continuously\nupdated via an automated pipeline that decomposes each problem into a series of\nfunction-level subproblems based on its dependency tree and each subproblem is\npaired with unit tests. We further propose a novel evaluation framework with\ntasks and metrics tailored to multi-turn code reuse to assess model\nperformance. In experiments across various LLMs under both multi-turn and\nsingle-turn patterns. We observe models' poor performance on CodeFlowBench,\nwith a substantial performance drop in the iterative codeflow scenario. For\ninstance, o1-mini achieves a pass@1 of 20.8% in multi-turn pattern versus 37.8%\nin single-turn pattern. Further analysis shows that different models excel at\ndifferent dependency depths, yet all struggle to correctly solve structurally\ncomplex problems, highlighting challenges for current LLMs to serve as code\ngeneration tools when performing codeflow. Overall, CodeFlowBench offers a\ncomprehensive benchmark and new insights into LLM capabilities for multi-turn,\niterative code generation, guiding future advances in code generation tasks."}

Existing datasets\nare small, with at most 1,000s of training instances from 11 or fewer GitHub\nrepositories. The procedures to curate such datasets are often complex,\nnecessitating hundreds of hours of human labor; companion execution\nenvironments also take up several terabytes of storage, severely limiting their\nscalability and usability. To address this pain point, we introduce SWE-smith,\na novel pipeline for generating software engineering training data at scale.\nGiven any Python codebase, SWE-smith constructs a corresponding execution\nenvironment, then automatically synthesizes 100s to 1,000s of task instances\nthat break existing test(s) in the codebase. Using SWE-smith, we create a\ndataset of 50k instances sourced from 128 GitHub repositories, an order of\nmagnitude larger than all previous works. We train SWE-agent-LM-32B, achieving\n40.2% Pass@1 resolve rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, state of the art\namong open source models. We open source SWE-smith (collection procedure, task\ninstances, trajectories, models) to lower the barrier of entry for research in\nLM systems for automated software engineering.
