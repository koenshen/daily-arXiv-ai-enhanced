This research introduces Rosetta-PL, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning and generalization\ncapabilities in a controlled environment. We construct Rosetta-PL by\ntranslating a dataset of logical propositions from Lean into a custom logical\nlanguage, which is then used to fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o).

If the mind is\na digital computer, as computationalism claims, then it can be computing either\nover meaningful symbols or over meaningless symbols.

If the mind is\ncomputing over meaningless symbols, no intentional cognitive processes are\navailable prior to symbol grounding. In this case, no symbol grounding could\ntake place since any grounding presupposes intentional cognitive processes.

Multi-task\nlearning (MTL) addresses this challenge by transferring shared knowledge from\nsource tasks to target tasks. As an dominant parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nmethod, prompt tuning (PT) enhances MTL by introducing an adaptable vector that\ncaptures task-specific knowledge, which acts as a prefix to the original prompt\nthat preserves shared knowledge, while keeping PLM parameters frozen.

Existing accident data collection is\nlargely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and\ninconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these\nchallenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping\ncode generation, news collection from online sources, accident news\nclassification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The\nsystem uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless\nautomation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination,\ndynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts\nfor scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as\ndate, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and\npedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by\nremoving duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites\nover 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news\narticles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module\nachieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy.

At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline\nis designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology\nis adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers.

At the computational optimization level, inference optimization\ntechniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are\nintegrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt\nto different types of medical problems.

Drawing\ninsights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to\nsimplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel\nself-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA).

LEPA refines the plan\nthrough self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in\nyielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to\npredict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions.

We expand upon existing research by conducting\ntwo survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine\nwhether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using\nLLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into\naccount both the \"receive\" and \"accept\" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller\n1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended\ninteractions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot\ninteractions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects\n(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced\ncontent). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct\npolitical domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual\ncampaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the\nreal-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact\nconditional on exposure.

In this study, we propose a\nFact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of\nLLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM\noptimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark\ncomprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity\nlevels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery\nenvironment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a\nvalidated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer\naccuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate.\nExperimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple\naggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in\narithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4),\nwith semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases.\nQualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as\nmisapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping\noperations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in\nbusiness-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency\nvalidation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a\nreproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable\nnatural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems."}

We introduce FineScope, a framework for\nderiving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models.\nFineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its\nability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract\ndomain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with\ndomain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain\nessential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance,\nthese pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated\ndatasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning.\nExtensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves\nhighly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale\nstate-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show\nthat FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their\noriginal performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore,\napplying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also\nimproves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our\napproach. The code will be released."}

Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes\nmessages from each role -- a concept we call \\emph{role separation} -- is\ncrucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets\nstate-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such\nmethods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known\ntriggers. In this paper, we examine \\emph{role-separation learning}: the\nprocess of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.\nThrough a \\emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that\nfine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task\ntype exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data\naugmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to\niterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose\nreinforcing \\emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting\ntoken-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating\nposition IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on\nsuperficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our\nwork illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role\nbehavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers."}
