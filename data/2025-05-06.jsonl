This risk\nis further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from\nmultiple modalities (image and text).

Evaluating how\neffectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning)\nnecessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs.\nWhile prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning\nremains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal\nunlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as\nan attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific\nmultimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset\nusing an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for\ntesting generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for\nmaintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven\nattacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method\nleveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal\nattacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective\ndefense removes answer information from internal model states.

While existing research extensively\naddresses demographic and ethical biases, broader dimensions-such as attitudes\ntoward authority, equality, autonomy, and fate-remain under-explored. In this\npaper, we introduce the Social Worldview Taxonomy (SWT), a structured framework\ngrounded in Cultural Theory, operationalizing four canonical worldviews\n(Hierarchy, Egalitarianism, Individualism, Fatalism) into measurable\nsub-dimensions. Using SWT, we empirically identify distinct and interpretable\ncognitive profiles across 28 diverse LLMs. Further, inspired by Social\nReferencing Theory, we experimentally demonstrate that explicit social cues\nsystematically shape these cognitive attitudes, revealing both general response\npatterns and nuanced model-specific variations. Our findings enhance the\ninterpretability of LLMs by revealing implicit socio-cognitive biases and their\nresponsiveness to social feedback, thus guiding the development of more\ntransparent and socially responsible language technologies."}

This paper\nintroduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output\nTransformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven\ntransformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic\nalignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight\nschema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic\ncontext construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile\nof the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured\nprompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable\noutputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates\na refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based\non execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches\nthat rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a\nreasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of\nadjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction.

In this work, we show that by\nemploying smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust\nCLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living\norganisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet,\na dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which\nenables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time."}

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval\nremain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a\ngood sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue\nsearching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may\nprovide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge.\nExisting solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled\nprocess supervision data or lead to subpar performance.\n  This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework,\n\\textbf{SIM-RAG}, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and\nmulti-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system\nself-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs\nwith intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic\ntraining data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths,\nwhich are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and\nunsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information\nsufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG\nsystem has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval\ndecisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context\nreinforcement learning.\n  Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an\neffective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is\nsystem-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring\nmodifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient,\neliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process\nsupervision data."}

We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent\nevaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., \"If you find that\nthe button is disabled, don't click it again\", or \"This agent has too much\nautonomy to decide what to do on its own\", into metrics for evaluating\nfine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by\ngrounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and\nnegative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and\nconcrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as\nevaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a\nset of (induced) metrics with open feedback: \"coverage\" and \"redundancy\".\nThrough optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate\nAutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the\nones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics\nto analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent\nimprovement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better\nprompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text\ngame tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second,\nwe show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for\nweb navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful\ntask-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents."}

Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have\nenabled automated CXR interpretation, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and\nefficiency. However, despite their strong visual understanding, current Medical\nLMMs (MLMMs) still face two major challenges: (1) Insufficient region-level\nunderstanding and interaction, and (2) Limited accuracy and interpretability\ndue to single-step reasoning. In this paper, we empower MLMMs with\nanatomy-centric reasoning capabilities to enhance their interactivity and\nexplainability.

While recent\nadvancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and\ntraining data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the\neffectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how\nto activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how\nReinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling.\nSpecifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL\ntask.

To address this\nissue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training\nloss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods.\nThese refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior\nperformance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from\ndiverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the\nStableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance\non multimodal reward modeling benchmarks.
