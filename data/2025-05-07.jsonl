To bridge the gap, we introduce\nSentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that\nmeasures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient\nAgent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during\ninteraction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in\nmulti-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its\nemotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a\nnumerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on\n100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score\ncorrelates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings\nand utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also\nbuild a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source\nmodels that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems\n(GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in\nconventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena).

QLoRA facilitates notable parameter\nefficiency and memory optimization, preserving the integrity of medical\ninformation through specialized quantization techniques.

This paper\ndetails the system's technical components, including its architecture,\nquantization methods, and key healthcare applications such as enhanced disease\nprediction from patient symptoms and medical history, treatment suggestions,\nand efficient summarization of complex medical reports. We touch on the ethical\nconsiderations-patient privacy, data security, and the need for rigorous\nclinical validation-as well as the practical challenges of integrating such\nsystems into real-world healthcare workflows.

Recent work on audio LMs has primarily\nevaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30\nseconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments\nthat more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We\nintroduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio\nbenchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation,\nemotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in\nlength. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each\npaired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers.\nOur audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent\na human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six\nopen-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them,\nincluding advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the\ntasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the\ntrade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that\naudio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as\nduration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning,\ncounting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on\nprompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework\nto develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities."}

To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce SepALM, a pioneering approach that employs audio\nlanguage models (ALMs) to rectify and re-synthesize speech within the text\ndomain following preliminary separation. SepALM comprises four core components:\na separator, a corrector, a synthesizer, and an aligner. By integrating an\nALM-based end-to-end error correction mechanism, we mitigate the risk of error\naccumulation and circumvent the optimization hurdles typically encountered in\nconventional methods that amalgamate automatic speech recognition (ASR) with\nlarge language models (LLMs). Additionally, we have developed Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting and knowledge distillation techniques to facilitate the\nreasoning and training processes of the ALM. Our experiments substantiate that\nSepALM not only elevates the precision of speech separation but also markedly\nbolsters adaptability in novel acoustic environments."}

Recent RLVR works that operate under the\nzero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still\ndepend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training.\nThe scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the\nlong-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already\nevident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a\nhypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by\nhumans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To\naddress these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in\nwhich a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning\nprogress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any\nexternal data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner\n(AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability\nby using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and\nverify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide\nopen-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without\nexternal data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical\nreasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens\nof thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is\ncompatible with various model classes."}

To alleviate this issue, we\npropose a novel Features Matrix (FM) regularization approach designed to\nenhance these models on target-unspecific tasks. Our method extracts and\nleverages general knowledge, shaping a Features Matrix (FM). Specifically, the\nFM captures the semantics of diverse inputs from a deep and fine perspective,\npreserving essential general knowledge, which mitigates the risk of\noverfitting.

The key novelty of\nlingual-backdoor attacks is that the language itself serves as the trigger to\nhijack the infected LLMs to generate inflammatory speech. They enable the\nprecise targeting of a specific language-speaking group, exacerbating racial\ndiscrimination by malicious entities. We first implement a baseline\nlingual-backdoor attack, which is carried out by poisoning a set of training\ndata for specific downstream tasks through translation into the trigger\nlanguage. However, this baseline attack suffers from poor task generalization\nand is impractical in real-world settings. To address this challenge, we design\nBadLingual, a novel task-agnostic lingual-backdoor, capable of triggering any\ndownstream tasks within the chat LLMs, regardless of the specific questions of\nthese tasks. We design a new approach using PPL-constrained Greedy Coordinate\nGradient-based Search (PGCG) based adversarial training to expand the decision\nboundary of lingual-backdoor, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of\nlingual-backdoor across various tasks. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed attacks. Specifically, the baseline\nattack achieves an ASR of over 90% on the specified tasks. However, its ASR\nreaches only 37.61% across six tasks in the task-agnostic scenario. In\ncontrast, BadLingual brings up to 37.35% improvement over the baseline. Our\nstudy sheds light on a new perspective of vulnerabilities in LLMs with\nmultilingual capabilities and is expected to promote future research on the\npotential defenses to enhance the LLMs' robustness"}
