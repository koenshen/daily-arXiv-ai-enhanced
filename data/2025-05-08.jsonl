Existing\nstate-of-the-art UQ methods rely on consistency among multiple responses\ngenerated by the LLM on an input query under diverse settings. However, these\napproaches often report higher confidence in scenarios where the LLM is\nconsistently incorrect. This leads to a poorly calibrated confidence with\nrespect to accuracy. To address this, we leverage cross-modal consistency in\naddition to self-consistency to improve the calibration of the multi-modal\nmodels. Specifically, we ground the textual responses to the visual inputs. The\nconfidence from the grounding model is used to calibrate the overall\nconfidence. Given that using a grounding model adds its own uncertainty in the\npipeline, we apply temperature scaling - a widely accepted parametric\ncalibration technique - to calibrate the grounding model's confidence in the\naccuracy of generated responses. We evaluate the proposed approach across\nmultiple multi-modal tasks, such as medical question answering (Slake) and\nvisual question answering (VQAv2), considering multi-modal models such as\nLLaVA-Med and LLaVA. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework\nachieves significantly improved calibration on both tasks."}

(2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires\nfrequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search\nrequests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain\nscalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a\nreinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of\nLLMs without interacting with real search engines. Our approach begins with\nlightweight supervised fine-tuning to transform the LLM into a retrieval module\ncapable of generating both relevant and noisy documents in response to a query.\nDuring RL training, we employ a curriculum-based rollout strategy that\nincrementally degrades the quality of generated documents, progressively\neliciting the model's reasoning ability by exposing it to increasingly\nchallenging retrieval scenarios.
