A Benchmark for LLMs' Capabilities in Multi-user Multi-turn Social Agent Tasks", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life,\ninstead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with\nonly one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently\nplay roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social\nsettings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically\nmeasured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an\nagent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles.\nConcurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII\nbelow), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social\nagents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages:\nformat parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable\nconversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion\ncapabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset,\nHSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform\nan ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs'\nsocial performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new\nstatistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs\nwith COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between\nmeasurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments\ndemonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in\nLLMs."}

Previous efforts have focused on designing\nvarious downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions\nbetween tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture\nrelations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we\nattempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning\nmodules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it\nis foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to\nthe quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the\ninput sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges:\noverly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the\ntagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention\nmechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former\nmodifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local\nattention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different\nattention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the\nT-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with lower computational costs."}

Based\non this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In\nStep-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains\nby reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the\ngeneration of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to\nstabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when\nconfidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning\nLRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields significantly shorter outputs, reducing\nlength by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task\naccuracy. ConCISE consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple\nreasoning benchmarks."}

In artificial\nintelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and\nmultimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and\nadaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a\npromising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and\nvideo to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve\ncomprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As\nresearch advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,\nperception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer\nmore coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and\nreinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges\nremain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To\naddress these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of\nmultimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental\nroadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging\ncapabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,\nwhere reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,\nalignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning\ninto multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)\nand multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured\nreasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging\nbenchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the\nconceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),\nwhich aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in\ncomplex, real-world environments."}
