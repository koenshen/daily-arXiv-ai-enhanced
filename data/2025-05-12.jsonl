Most previous research on HTC has focused on\nsupervised methods. However, in real-world scenarios, employing supervised HTC\ncan be challenging due to a lack of annotated data. Moreover, HTC often faces\nissues with large label spaces and long-tail distributions. In this work, we\npresent Knowledge Graphs for zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification\n(KG-HTC), which aims to address these challenges of HTC in applications by\nintegrating knowledge graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide\nstructured semantic context during classification. Our method retrieves\nrelevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs related to the input text using a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our KG-HTC can enhance LLMs to\nunderstand label semantics at various hierarchy levels. We evaluate KG-HTC on\nthree open-source HTC datasets: WoS, DBpedia, and Amazon. Our experimental\nresults show that KG-HTC significantly outperforms three baselines in the\nstrict zero-shot setting, particularly achieving substantial improvements at\ndeeper levels of the hierarchy.

Processing-in-memory\n(PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth\nand compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily\noptimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access\npatterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques.

As such, LLMs\nhave the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify\nthe task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they\nneed through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM\nconversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in\nuser instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn,\nfully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale\nsimulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn\nsettings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs\nwe test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations\nthan single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks.\nAnalysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance\ndegradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant\nincrease in unreliability.
