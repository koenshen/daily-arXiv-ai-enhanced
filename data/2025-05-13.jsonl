However,\nexisting tool selection frameworks do not integrate MCP servers, instead\nrelying heavily on error-prone manual updates to monolithic local tool\nrepositories, leading to duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies.\nAdditionally, current approaches abstract tool selection before the LLM agent\nis invoked, limiting its autonomy and hindering dynamic re-querying\ncapabilities during multi-turn interactions. To address these issues, we\nintroduce ScaleMCP, a novel tool selection approach that dynamically equips LLM\nagents with a MCP tool retriever, giving agents the autonomy to add tools into\ntheir memory, as well as an auto-synchronizing tool storage system pipeline\nthrough CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations with MCP servers as the\nsingle source of truth. We also propose a novel embedding strategy, Tool\nDocument Weighted Average (TDWA), designed to selectively emphasize critical\ncomponents of tool documents (e.g. tool name or synthetic questions) during the\nembedding process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on a created dataset of\n5,000 financial metric MCP servers, across 10 LLM models, 5 embedding models,\nand 5 retriever types, demonstrate substantial improvements in tool retrieval\nand agent invocation performance, emphasizing ScaleMCP's effectiveness in\nscalable, dynamic tool selection and invocation."}

The proposed approach addresses conventional healthcare Multi-Label\nText Classification (MLTC) challenges by integrating knowledge distillation and\nsequential fine-tuning, subsequently optimized through Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning. KDH-MLTC transfers knowledge from\na more complex teacher LLM (i.e., BERT) to a lighter student LLM (i.e.,\nDistilBERT) through sequential training adapted to MLTC that preserves the\nteacher's learned information while significantly reducing computational\nrequirements.

Each profile defines a set of functions\nparse_by_scene(scene) that outputs a list of logic-grounded assertions\ntriggered_statements, using both explicit control structures (e.g.,\nif-then-else) and condition checks like check_condition(scene, question), where\neach question is a semantically meaningful prompt about the scene (e.g., \"Is\nthe character in danger?\") discriminated by the role-playing LLM as true,\nfalse, or unknown. This explicit representation offers three key advantages\nover traditional prompt-based profiles, which append character descriptions\ndirectly into text prompts: (1) Persistence, by enforcing complete and\nconsistent execution of character logic, rather than relying on the model's\nimplicit reasoning; (2) Updatability, through systematic inspection and\nrevision of behavioral logic, which is difficult to track or debug in\nprompt-only approaches; (3) Controllable Randomness, by supporting stochastic\nbehavior directly within the logic, enabling fine-grained variability that\nprompting alone struggles to achieve. To validate these advantages, we\nintroduce a new benchmark constructed from 83 characters and 5,141 scenes\ncurated from Fandom, using NLI-based scoring to compare character responses\nagainst ground-truth actions. Our experiments demonstrate the significant\nbenefits of codified profiles in improving persistence, updatability, and\nbehavioral diversity. Notably, by offloading a significant portion of reasoning\nto preprocessing, codified profiles enable even 1B-parameter models to perform\nhigh-quality role-playing, providing a scalable and efficient foundation for\nlocal deployment of role-play agents."}

Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited\nremarkable chemical knowledge, hinting at their potential to tackle complex\ndecision-making tasks in chemistry. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can\nsuccessfully navigate the highly constrained, multi-step retrosynthesis\nplanning problem. We introduce an efficient scheme for encoding reaction\npathways and present a new route-level search strategy, moving beyond the\nconventional step-by-step reactant prediction. Through comprehensive\nevaluations, we show that our LLM-augmented approach excels at retrosynthesis\nplanning and extends naturally to the broader challenge of synthesizable\nmolecular design."}

A critical step in this process is the development of complex Boolean\nqueries to retrieve relevant literature. Given the difficulty of manually\nconstructing these queries, recent efforts have explored Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to assist in their formulation. One of the first studies,Wang et al.,\ninvestigated ChatGPT for this task, followed by Staudinger et al., which\nevaluated multiple LLMs in a reproducibility study. However, the latter\noverlooked several key aspects of the original work, including (i) validation\nof generated queries, (ii) output formatting constraints, and (iii) selection\nof examples for chain-of-thought (Guided) prompting. As a result, its findings\ndiverged significantly from the original study. In this work, we systematically\nreproduce both studies while addressing these overlooked factors. Our results\nshow that query effectiveness varies significantly across models and prompt\ndesigns, with guided query formulation benefiting from well-chosen seed\nstudies. Overall, prompt design and model selection are key drivers of\nsuccessful query formulation. Our findings provide a clearer understanding of\nLLMs' potential in Boolean query generation and highlight the importance of\nmodel- and prompt-specific optimisations. The complex nature of systematic\nreviews adds to challenges in both developing and reproducing methods but also\nhighlights the importance of reproducibility studies in this domain."}

Recent research has\nquestioned the role of fine-tuning vs. that of pre-training within dense\nretrievers, specifically arguing that retrieval knowledge is primarily gained\nduring pre-training, meaning knowledge not acquired during pre-training cannot\nbe sub-sequentially acquired via fine-tuning. We revisit this idea here as the\nclaim was only studied in the context of a BERT-based encoder using DPR as\nrepresentative dense retriever. We extend the previous analysis by testing\nother representation approaches (comparing the use of CLS tokens with that of\nmean pooling), backbone architectures (encoder-only BERT vs. decoder-only\nLLaMA), and additional datasets (MSMARCO in addition to Natural Questions). Our\nstudy confirms that in DPR tuning, pre-trained knowledge underpins retrieval\nperformance, with fine-tuning primarily adjusting neuron activation rather than\nreorganizing knowledge.

Through comprehensive\nobservations, we find that safety-aligned LLMs and various defense strategies\ngenerate highly similar initial tokens in their refusal responses, which we\ndefine as safety trigger tokens.
