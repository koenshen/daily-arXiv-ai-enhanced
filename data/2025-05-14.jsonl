These\ncustom GPTs empower users to browse and interact with specialized applications\ndesigned to meet specific needs. However, as custom GPTs see growing adoption,\nconcerns regarding their security vulnerabilities have intensified. Existing\nresearch on these vulnerabilities remains largely theoretical, often lacking\nempirical, large-scale, and statistically rigorous assessments of associated\nrisks.\n  In this study, we analyze 14,904 custom GPTs to assess their susceptibility\nto seven exploitable threats, such as roleplay-based attacks, system prompt\nleakage, phishing content generation, and malicious code synthesis, across\nvarious categories and popularity tiers within the OpenAI marketplace. We\nintroduce a multi-metric ranking system to examine the relationship between a\ncustom GPT's popularity and its associated security risks.\n  Our findings reveal that over 95% of custom GPTs lack adequate security\nprotections. The most prevalent vulnerabilities include roleplay-based\nvulnerabilities (96.51%), system prompt leakage (92.20%), and phishing\n(91.22%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that OpenAI's foundational models exhibit\ninherent security weaknesses, which are often inherited or amplified in custom\nGPTs. These results highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures\nand stricter content moderation to ensure the safe deployment of GPT-based\napplications."}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses\nthese gaps by coupling generation with external search. We analyse how\nhyperparameters influence speed and quality in RAG systems, covering Chroma and\nFaiss vector stores, chunking policies, cross-encoder re-ranking, and\ntemperature, and we evaluate six metrics: faithfulness, answer correctness,\nanswer relevancy, context precision, context recall, and answer similarity.\nChroma processes queries 13% faster, whereas Faiss yields higher retrieval\nprecision, revealing a clear speed-accuracy trade-off. Naive fixed-length\nchunking with small windows and minimal overlap outperforms semantic\nsegmentation while remaining the quickest option. Re-ranking provides modest\ngains in retrieval quality yet increases runtime by roughly a factor of 5, so\nits usefulness depends on latency constraints. These results help practitioners\nbalance computational cost and accuracy when tuning RAG systems for\ntransparent, up-to-date responses. Finally, we re-evaluate the top\nconfigurations with a corrective RAG workflow and show that their advantages\npersist when the model can iteratively request additional evidence. We obtain a\nnear-perfect context precision (99%), which demonstrates that RAG systems can\nachieve extremely high retrieval accuracy with the right combination of\nhyperparameters, with significant implications for applications where retrieval\nquality directly impacts downstream task performance, such as clinical decision\nsupport in healthcare."}

However, crafting\neffective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often\nrequiring extensive trial and error. Existing prompt inversion approaches, such\nas soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited\ninterpretability and incoherent prompt generation. To address these issues, we\npropose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages\nlarge language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and\nsemantically aligned prompts. In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text\ngeneration capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts. Further, by\nemploying CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts,\nVGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt\ngeneration without the need for additional training. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in\ngenerating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more\nintuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models."}

Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific\nhuman analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale\nwith the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in\nthese settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs\nand language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional\nsoftware debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and\ndynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal\ntaxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set\nof 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and\ngrounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we\ncurate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world\napplications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval.\nOur evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace\ndebugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our\ndataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future\nresearch in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows."}

To operationalize\nthis insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM)\nobjective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization\nproblem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction\nperformance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle\nduring LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient\nalignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of\nrepresentation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive\ntrade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation\nbetween awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively\nswitches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2\npretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves\ncross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining\ntask on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate\ncatastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and\nseparating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation -\nparalleling the functional role of sleep consolidation."}

In this work, we frame PDE solving as a code\ngeneration task and introduce CodePDE, the first inference framework for\ngenerating PDE solvers using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging advanced\ninference-time algorithms and scaling strategies, CodePDE unlocks critical\ncapacities of LLM for PDE solving: reasoning, debugging, selfrefinement, and\ntest-time scaling -- all without task-specific tuning. CodePDE achieves\nsuperhuman performance across a range of representative PDE problems. We also\npresent a systematic empirical analysis of LLM generated solvers, analyzing\ntheir accuracy, efficiency, and numerical scheme choices. Our findings\nhighlight the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in PDE solving,\noffering a new perspective on solver design and opportunities for future model\ndevelopment.
