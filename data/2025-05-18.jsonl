In this\npaper, we first propose CoV-Eval, a multi-task benchmark covering various tasks\nsuch as code completion, vulnerability repair, vulnerability detection and\nclassification, for comprehensive evaluation of LLM code security. Besides, we\ndeveloped VC-Judge, an improved judgment model that aligns closely with human\nexperts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more\nefficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20\nproprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable\ncodes well, they still tend to generate insecure codes and struggle with\nrecognizing specific vulnerability types and performing repairs. Extensive\nexperiments and qualitative analyses reveal key challenges and optimization\ndirections, offering insights for future research in LLM code security."}

In\nXLT for token classification tasks, however, these strategies include label\nprojection, the challenging step of mapping the labels from each token in the\noriginal sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. Although word\naligners (WAs) are commonly used for label projection, the low-level design\ndecisions for applying them to translation-based XLT have not been\nsystematically investigated. Moreover, recent marker-based methods, which\nproject labeled spans by inserting tags around them before (or after)\ntranslation, claim to outperform WAs in label projection for XLT. In this work,\nwe revisit WAs for label projection, systematically investigating the effects\nof low-level design decisions on token-level XLT: (i) the algorithm for\nprojecting labels between (multi-)token spans, (ii) filtering strategies to\nreduce the number of noisily mapped labels, and (iii) the pre-tokenization of\nthe translated sentences. We find that all of these substantially impact\ntranslation-based XLT performance and show that, with optimized choices, XLT\nwith WA offers performance at least comparable to that of marker-based methods.\nWe then introduce a new projection strategy that ensembles translate-train and\ntranslate-test predictions and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms\nthe marker-based projection. Crucially, we show that our proposed ensembling\nalso reduces sensitivity to low-level WA design choices, resulting in more\nrobust XLT for token classification tasks."}

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL\nefficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for\nexplaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a\ncritical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering\nnovel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies."}

However, the origin of this\nneural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model\nsize -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also\nagree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an\nimportant mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws.

We introduce the third and\nmore inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel\ncomputation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and\nlearnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in\nparallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely\nparallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing\nparameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure,\ndata, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it\nthrough large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel\nstreams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\\log P)$ while showing\nsuperior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\\times$\nless memory increase and 6$\\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter\nscaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an\noff-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training\non a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new\nscaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more\npowerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative\nperspective for the role of computation in machine learning."}

In digital\ncontent creation tools, where users express their needs through natural\nlanguage queries that must be mapped to API calls, the lack of real-world\ntask-specific data and privacy constraints for training on it necessitate\nsynthetic data generation. Existing approaches to synthetic data generation\nfall short in diversity and complexity, failing to replicate real-world data\ndistributions and leading to suboptimal performance after LLM fine-tuning. We\npresent a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like\ncontent metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and\nvision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training\ndata. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data\ngeneration that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a\nfundamental limitation of traditional approaches. Evaluation on a comprehensive\nset of real user queries demonstrates significant improvements in both function\nclassification accuracy and API parameter selection. Models fine-tuned with our\nsynthetic data consistently outperform traditional approaches, establishing new\nbenchmarks for function calling tasks."}

However, applying this technique to\nvision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small\nlanguage models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural\ncomponents to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match\nthose of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce\nMultimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of\nVision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models\ninto effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first\nconnects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight\ntrainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning\nusing responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions.\nComprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families\ndemonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers\nend-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV\nprovides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both\ncurrent and future VLMs."}

This study\nsystematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,\nand planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of\nagents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in\ndynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller\nones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a\ntoo-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,\nwhile larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting\ntechniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less\nimprovement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find\nthat advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable\nof significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making\nalign, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.\nCompared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true\nemergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits\npersistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and\nspatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models\nstill suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through\nself-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while\nreasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math\nword problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important\nshortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move\nbeyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning."}
