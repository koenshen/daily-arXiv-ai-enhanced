This question is central to the ability of LLMs in inductive\nreasoning. Existing research on LLM-based inductive reasoning can be broadly\ncategorized based on whether the underlying rules are expressible via explicit\nmathematical equations. However, many recent studies in the beyond-equations\ncategory have emphasized rule design without grounding them in specific\nscenarios. Inspired by the parallels between inductive reasoning and human\nscientific discovery, we propose the task of LLM-Based Scientific Inductive\nReasoning Beyond Equations and introduce a new benchmark, SIRBench-V1, to\nevaluate the inductive reasoning abilities of LLMs in scientific settings. Our\nexperimental results show that current LLMs still struggle with this task,\nunderscoring its difficulty and the need for further advancement in this area."}

Studies have attempted\nto assess the psychometric properties of LLMs by borrowing concepts from human\npsychology to enhance their interpretability, but they fail to account for the\nfundamental differences between LLMs and humans. This results in high rejection\nrates when human scales are reused directly. Furthermore, these scales do not\nsupport the measurement of LLM psychological property variations in different\nlanguages. This paper introduces AIPsychoBench, a specialized benchmark\ntailored to assess the psychological properties of LLM. It uses a lightweight\nrole-playing prompt to bypass LLM alignment, improving the average effective\nresponse rate from 70.12% to 90.40%. Meanwhile, the average biases are only\n3.3% (positive) and 2.1% (negative), which are significantly lower than the\nbiases of 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively, caused by traditional jailbreak prompts.\nFurthermore, among the total of 112 psychometric subcategories, the score\ndeviations for seven languages compared to English ranged from 5% to 20.2% in\n43 subcategories, providing the first comprehensive evidence of the linguistic\nimpact on the psychometrics of LLM."}

Our model is trained on over\n4.5 million authors across 36 languages and 13 domains.

We empirically tested these\ncontrasting scenarios by varying key interaction patterns. We find that\nstate-of-the-art models: (1) are more likely to endorse a user's\ncounterargument when framed as a follow-up from a user, rather than when both\nresponses are presented simultaneously for evaluation; (2) show increased\nsusceptibility to persuasion when the user's rebuttal includes detailed\nreasoning, even when the conclusion of the reasoning is incorrect; and (3) are\nmore readily swayed by casually phrased feedback than by formal critiques, even\nwhen the casual input lacks justification.

Next, we collate existing datasets and evaluation\nbenchmarks currently used for RL fine-tuning, spanning human-annotated\ndatasets, AI-assisted preference data, and program-verification-style corpora.\nSubsequently, we review the mainstream open-source tools and training\nframeworks available, providing clear practical references for subsequent\nresearch. Finally, we analyse the future challenges and trends in the field of\nRL-enhanced LLMs. This survey aims to present researchers and practitioners\nwith the latest developments and frontier trends at the intersection of RL and\nLLMs, with the goal of fostering the evolution of LLMs that are more\nintelligent, generalizable, and secure."}

While MLA already achieves\nsignificant KV cache reduction, the scope for further compression remains\nlimited without performance loss. In this paper, we propose\n\\textbf{Embedding-Gated Multi-head Latent Attention (EG-MLA)}, a novel\nextension of MLA that further reduces KV cache size while enhancing\nrepresentational expressiveness.

Moreover, training an interactive\nagent for this specific task is hindered by the shortage of high-quality\ninteraction trajectories. In this work, we propose AirQA, a human-annotated\ncomprehensive paper QA dataset in the field of artificial intelligence (AI),\nwith 13,948 papers and 1,246 questions, that encompasses multi-task,\nmulti-modal and instance-level evaluation. Furthermore, we propose ExTrActor,\nan automated framework for instruction data synthesis. With three LLM-based\nagents, ExTrActor can perform example generation and trajectory collection\nwithout human intervention. Evaluations of multiple open-source and proprietary\nmodels show that most models underperform on AirQA, demonstrating the quality\nof our dataset.

Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i)\nevicting entries after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and\n(ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to\ndegraded accuracy in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a\ntraining-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question\nanswering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth\nthrough block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV\ncompression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and\napplies episode-specific KV cache eviction. We further design an adaptive\nlayer-wise budget allocation strategy that measures each layer's sensitivity to\neviction and distributes the memory budget across layers accordingly.

We propose In-Context Representation Learning (ICRL) as a\nproof-of-concept to allow LLMs to adaptively utilize non-text modality\nrepresentations with few-shot learning. Unlike traditional in-context learning,\nwhich incorporates text-label pairs, ICRL replaces text inputs with FM\nrepresentations, enabling the LLM to perform multi-modal inference without\nfine-tuning. We evaluate ICRL on a suite of tasks in the molecular domain,\ninvestigating three core research questions: (i) how to map FM representations\ninto LLMs in a training-free manner, (ii) what factors influence ICRL\nperformance, and (iii) what mechanisms underlie the effectiveness of ICRL. To\nthe best of our knowledge, ICRL is the first training-free framework for\nintegrating non-text modality representations into text-based LLMs, presenting\na promising direction for adaptable, multi-modal generalization."}

It is increasingly complex for users to consume and\nextract meaningful information efficiently. Thus, raising the need for\nsummarization. Unlike short document summarization, long document abstractive\nsummarization is resource-intensive, and very little literature is present in\nthis direction. BART is a widely used efficient sequence-to-sequence\n(seq-to-seq) model. However, when it comes to summarizing long documents, the\nlength of the context window limits its capabilities. We proposed a model\ncalled PTS (Page-specific Target-text alignment Summarization) that extends the\nseq-to-seq method for abstractive summarization by dividing the source document\ninto several pages. PTS aligns each page with the relevant part of the target\nsummary for better supervision. Partial summaries are generated for each page\nof the document. We proposed another model called PTSPI (Page-specific\nTarget-text alignment Summarization with Page Importance), an extension to PTS\nwhere an additional layer is placed before merging the partial summaries into\nthe final summary.

In this work, we conduct a\npreliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC\nestimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and\noverestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation\ncapabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo\nAnnotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning\nframework. Our key findings indicate that: (1) Even lightweight models (e.g.,\n1.5B parameters) can produce high-quality annotations through a self-denoising\nstrategy, enabling PRMs to achieve superior performance with only 6% the\ninference cost required by vanilla MC estimation. (2) With our robust learning\nstrategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a\n39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench.

Recent\nadvances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract\nmeaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are\noften missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of\npatients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations\ncan be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or\nradiology reports. Yet the availability of these modalities is influenced by\nclinical decision-making and varies across patients, resulting in modality\nmissing-not-at-random (MMNAR) patterns. We propose a causal representation\nlearning framework that leverages observed data and informative missingness in\nmultimodal clinical records. It consists of: (1) an MMNAR-aware modality fusion\ncomponent that integrates structured data, imaging, and text while conditioning\non missingness patterns to capture patient health and clinician-driven\nassignment; (2) a modality reconstruction component with contrastive learning\nto ensure semantic sufficiency in representation learning; and (3) a multitask\noutcome prediction model with a rectifier that corrects for residual bias from\nspecific modality observation patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across\nMIMIC-IV and eICU show consistent gains over the strongest baselines, achieving\nup to 13.8% AUC improvement for hospital readmission and 13.1% for ICU\nadmission."}

Hyper-parallel\nscaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token\nfrom the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models,\nwhich we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference\nalgorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects\ncontrolled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to\nsample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for\na more accurate final prediction.To overcome the computational cost, we\nintroduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism\nthat minimizes compute and memory overhead.

From a first principle perspective, the\nbreakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two\ncomplementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries\nwith contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step\nreasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate\nreasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock\nsubstantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking\nsystems.\n  In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly\nintegrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and\nranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure\nTransformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1)\nstructured context engineering, which augments interaction history with\npreference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized\ninput sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning,\nwhich equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales\nreasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which\nleverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during\ntraining. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario\nof Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business\nmetrics, including over $+2\\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\\%$ increase in advertising\nrevenue."}

However, current\nmethods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector,\npotentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or\nproduce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector\nretrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal\nretrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and\ninteracted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta\nTokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer\ncontextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector\nembeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training,\nMetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple\nvectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval,\nwhere users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by\nselecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions.\nExtensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and\nthe Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed\nachieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to\nmodels with 32B parameters."}
