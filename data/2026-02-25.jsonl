We propose SA-SFT, a lightweight self-augmentation routine in which an LLM generates self-dialogues prior to fine-tuning, and the resulting self-authored data are mixed with task data without modifying optimization or training schedules.\n  Despite requiring no external data or additional tuning, SA-SFT consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting while improving in-domain performance. Across 50 evaluation scenarios, it maintains performance comparable to the original model and achieves the best results in 40 cases, outperforming common baselines such as layer freezing and external data mixing. Guided by these empirical findings, we further present a theoretical analysis suggesting that forgetting can partly stem from style-induced parameter drift, and that self-alignment through self-generated data provides an effective means to counteract this effect. Overall, our results indicate that self-augmentation offers a simple and effective mechanism for robust LLM adaptation without incurring catastrophic forgetting."}

A common strategy is to train a reflection model as a filter to intercept false alerts with labelled data collected from user verification feedback. However, a key challenge is the noisy nature of such data as it is often collected in production environments. As cleaning noise via manual annotation incurs high costs, this paper proposes a novel method ConceptRM for constructing a high-quality corpus to train a reflection model capable of effectively intercepting false alerts. With only a small amount of expert annotations as anchors, ConceptRM creates perturbed datasets with varying noise ratios and utilizes co-teaching to train multiple distinct models for collaborative learning. By analyzing the consensus decisions of these models, it effectively identifies reliable negative samples from a noisy dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptRM significantly enhances the interception of false alerts with minimal annotation cost, outperforming several state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 53.31% on in-domain datasets and 41.67% on out-of-domain datasets."}

We extract over 671,000 question-answer pairs from 23,000 verified interview transcripts across 1,000 public personalities, each with an average of 11.5 hours of interview content. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework with four complementary metrics measuring content similarity, factual consistency, personality alignment, and factual knowledge retention. Through systematic comparison, we demonstrate that methods grounded in real interview data substantially outperform those relying solely on biographical profiles or the model's parametric knowledge. We further reveal a trade-off in how interview data is best utilized: retrieval-augmented methods excel at capturing personality style and response quality, while chronological-based methods better preserve factual consistency and knowledge retention. Our evaluation framework enables principled method selection based on application requirements, and our empirical findings provide actionable insights for advancing personality simulation research."}

Drawing on classical linguistics, we argue that a query's form can also shape a listener's (and model's) response. We operationalize this insight by constructing a 22-dimension query feature vector covering clause complexity, lexical rarity, and anaphora, negation, answerability, and intention grounding, all known to affect human comprehension. Using 369,837 real-world queries, we ask: Are there certain types of queries that make hallucination more likely? A large-scale analysis reveals a consistent \"risk landscape\": certain features such as deep clause nesting and underspecification align with higher hallucination propensity. In contrast, clear intention grounding and answerability align with lower hallucination rates. Others, including domain specificity, show mixed, dataset- and model-dependent effects. Thus, these findings establish an empirically observable query-feature representation correlated with hallucination risk, paving the way for guided query rewriting and future intervention studies."}

The dearth of studies focusing on hallucinations in closed-source models is especially concerning, as they constitute the vast majority of models in institutional deployments. We introduce QueryBandits, a model-agnostic contextual bandit framework that adaptively learns online to select the optimal query-rewrite strategy by leveraging an empirically validated and calibrated reward function. Across 16 QA scenarios, our top QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a No-Rewrite baseline and outperforms zero-shot static policies (e.g., Paraphrase or Expand) by 42.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Moreover, all contextual bandits outperform vanilla bandits across all datasets, with higher feature variance coinciding with greater variance in arm selection. This substantiates our finding that there is no single rewrite policy optimal for all queries. We also discover that certain static policies incur higher cumulative regret than No-Rewrite, indicating that an inflexible query-rewriting policy can worsen hallucinations. Thus, learning an online policy over semantic features with QueryBandits can shift model behavior purely through forward-pass mechanisms, enabling its use with closed-source models and bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation."}

BERT achieved the highest accuracy, consistently exceeding 99\\%, but required significantly longer training times and greater computational resources. The BiLSTM model provided a strong compromise, reaching approximately 98.56\\% accuracy while maintaining moderate training costs and offering robust contextual understanding. Naive Bayes proved to be the fastest to train, on the order of milliseconds, yet delivered the lowest accuracy, averaging around 94.5\\%. Class imbalance influenced all methods, particularly in the recognition of minority categories.\n  A fully functional demonstrative system was implemented to validate practical applicability, enabling automated routing of technical requests with throughput unattainable through manual processing. The study concludes that BiLSTM offers the most balanced solution for the examined scenario, while also outlining opportunities for future improvements and further exploration of transformer architectures."}

Yet, their utility for estimating downstream performance remains unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate the relationship between model performance and the unembedding matrix geometry, particularly its effective rank. Our experiments, involving a suite of 108 OLMo-style language models trained under controlled variation, reveal several key findings. While the best-performing models often exhibit a high effective rank, this trend is not universal across tasks and training setups. Contrary to prior work, we find that low effective rank does not cause late-stage performance degradation in small models, but instead co-occurs with it; we find adversarial cases where low-rank models do not exhibit saturation. Moreover, we show that effective rank is strongly influenced by pre-training hyperparameters, such as batch size and weight decay, which in-turn affect the model's performance. Lastly, extending our analysis to other geometric metrics and final-layer representation, we find that these metrics are largely aligned, but none can reliably predict downstream performance. Overall, our findings suggest that the model's geometry, as captured by existing metrics, primarily reflects training choices rather than performance."}

However, task-level success alone does not establish a model's fit for use in practice. In applied, high-stakes settings, LLM effectiveness is driven by a wider array of sociotechnical determinants that extend beyond conventional performance measures. Although a growing set of metrics capture many of these considerations, they are rarely organized in a way that supports consistent evaluation, leaving no unified taxonomy for assessing and comparing LLM utility across use cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Language Model Utility Taxonomy (LUX), a comprehensive framework that structures utility evaluation across four domains: performance, interaction, operations, and governance. Within each domain, LUX is organized hierarchically into thematically aligned dimensions and components, each grounded in metrics that enable quantitative comparison and alignment of model selection with intended use. In addition, an external dynamic web tool is provided to support exploration of the framework by connecting each component to a repository of relevant metrics (factors) for applied evaluation."}

On a manually curated set of 483 instances of PI, we measure memorization: finding that 13.6% are parroted verbatim by the Pythia-6.9b model, i.e., when the model is prompted with the tokens that precede the PI in the original document, greedy decoding generates the entire PI span exactly. We expand this analysis to study models of varying sizes (160M-6.9B) and pretraining time steps (70k-143k iterations) in the Pythia model suite and find that both model size and amount of pretraining are positively correlated with memorization.

Building on this insight, we propose CAMEL, a confidence-gated reflection framework that performs a lightweight single-token preference decision first and selectively invokes reflection only for low-confidence instances.

This approach cuts the number of trainable parameters while keeping the model's capacity intact. We evaluate ID-LoRA on five diverse benchmarks: Mathematical Reasoning, Code Generation, MMLU, CommonsenseQA, and Safety Alignment.

The novelty of our approach lies in its explicit encoding of sentence-level grammatical structure, including syntactic composition, phrase patterns, and complexity indicators, into a compact grammar vector, which is then fused with frozen contextual embeddings. These heterogeneous elements unified a single representation that captures both the structural and semantic characteristics of the text.

Overton Pluralism addresses this gap by generating responses with diverse perspectives from a single query. This paper introduces OP-GRPO (Overton Pluralistic Group Relative Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework for implicit Overton Pluralism that enables a single large language model to produce pluralistic responses without explicit prompting or modular orchestration. Our workflow consists of two main steps. First, similarity estimator training fine-tunes a Sentence Transformer for Overton Pluralism tasks to provide more accurate coverage evaluation of generated responses. Second, OP-GRPO training incorporates this similarity estimator into a dual-reward system designed to ensure both broad coverage of genuine human perspectives and the uniqueness of each perspective, thereby promoting diversity. Empirical results demonstrate a \"small models, big perspective coverage\" effect. The trained Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model surpasses a 20B GPT-OSS baseline with a 37.4 percent relative accuracy gain on a Natural Language Inference benchmark, and also outperforms a modular architecture baseline with a 19.1 percent relative improvement. Additional evaluations using GPT-4.1 as a large language model judge further confirm the robustness of the approach."}

Traditional KL divergence tends to be dominated by the next tokens with the highest probabilities, i.e., the teacher's modes, thereby diminishing the influence of less probable yet potentially informative components of the output distribution. We propose a new tail-aware divergence that decouples the contribution of the teacher model's top-K predicted probabilities from that of lower-probability predictions, while maintaining the same computational profile as the KL Divergence. Our decoupled approach reduces the impact of the teacher modes and, consequently, increases the contribution of the tail of the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our modified distillation method yields competitive performance in both pre-training and supervised distillation of decoder models across various datasets. Furthermore, the distillation process is efficient and can be performed with a modest academic budget for large datasets, eliminating the need for industry-scale computing."}

FinAnchor addresses the incompatibility of feature spaces by selecting an anchor embedding space and learning linear mappings to align representations from other models into this anchor. These aligned features are then aggregated to form a unified representation for downstream prediction. Across multiple financial NLP tasks, FinAnchor consistently outperforms strong single-model baselines and standard ensemble methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of anchoring heterogeneous representations for robust financial prediction."}

Analyzing this data has useful information to recognize the opinion of people in tweets. Sentiment analysis plays a vital role in NLP, which identifies the opinion of the individuals about a specific topic. Natural language processing in Persian has many challenges despite the adventure of strong language models. The datasets available in Persian are generally in special topics such as products, foods, hotels, etc while users may use ironies, colloquial phrases in social media To overcome these challenges, there is a necessity for having a dataset of Persian sentiment analysis on Twitter. In this paper, we introduce the Exa sentiment analysis Persian dataset, which is collected from Persian tweets. This dataset contains 12,000 tweets, annotated by 5 native Persian taggers. The aforementioned data is labeled in 3 classes: positive, neutral and negative. We present the characteristics and statistics of this dataset and use the pre-trained Pars Bert and Roberta as the base model to evaluate this dataset. Our evaluation reached a 79.87 Macro F-score, which shows the model and data can be adequately valuable for a sentiment analysis system."}

To address this issue, efficient reasoning aims to incentivize short yet accurate thinking trajectories, typically through reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we systematically investigate the mechanics of efficient reasoning for LLMs. For comprehensive evaluation, we advocate for more fine-grained metrics, including length distribution conditioned on correctness and performance across a wide spectrum of token budgets ranging from 2k to 32k. First, we reveal that the training process follows a two-stage paradigm: length adaptation and reasoning refinement. After that, we conduct extensive experiments (about 0.2 million GPU hours) in a unified protocol, deconstructing training prompts and rollouts, reward shaping, and optimization strategies. In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse. Meanwhile, the learned length bias can be generalized across domains. We distill all findings into valuable insights and practical guidelines, and further validate them across the Qwen3 series, ranging from 0.6B to 30B, demonstrating the robustness and generalization."}

BLMs are multiple-choice problems, structured at multiple levels: within each sentence, across the input sequence, within each candidate answer. Because of their rich structure, these curated, but naturalistic datasets are key to answer some core questions about current large language models abilities: do LLMs detect linguistic objects and their properties? Do they detect and use systematic patterns across sentences? Are they more prone to linguistic or reasoning errors, and how do these interact?\n  We show that BLMs, while challenging, can be solved at good levels of performance, in more than one language, with simple baseline models or, at better performance levels, with more tailored models. We show that their representations contain the grammatical objects and attributes relevant to solve a linguistic task. We also show that these solutions are reached by detecting systematic patterns across sentences.\n  The paper supports the point of view that curated, structured datasets support multi-faceted investigations of properties of language and large language models. Because they present a curated, articulated structure, because they comprise both learning contexts and expected answers, and because they are partly built by hand, BLMs fall in the category of datasets that can support explainability investigations, and be useful to ask why large language models behave the way they do."}

To address this limitation, we first introduce a novel first-order logic (FOL) dataset named PC-FOL, annotated by professional mathematicians, focusing on case-based reasoning problems. All instances in this dataset are equipped with a manually written natural language proof, clearly distinguishing it from conventional linear reasoning datasets. Our experimental results over leading LLMs demonstrate a substantial performance gap between linear reasoning and case-based reasoning problems. To further investigate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis grounded in graphical model, which provides an explanation for the observed disparity between the two types of reasoning problems. We hope this work can reveal the core challenges in the field of automated natural language mathematical proof generation, paving the way for future research."}

It contains 1,094 queries that simulate ordinary solution-seeking activities whose responses may induce latent ecological impact. Through experiments across five widely used LLMs, we analyze the effects of response length, languages, and modality.

However, effectively analyzing millions of unstructured reviews remains challenging. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for natural language understanding, their application to large-scale review analysis has been limited by computational costs and scalability concerns. This study proposes a hybrid approach that uses LLMs for aspect identification while employing classic machine-learning methods for sentiment classification at scale. Using ChatGPT to analyze sampled restaurant reviews, we identified key aspects of dining experiences and developed sentiment classifiers using human-labeled reviews, which we subsequently applied to 4.7 million reviews collected over 17 years from a major online platform. Regression analysis reveals that our machine-labeled aspects significantly explain variance in overall restaurant ratings across different aspects of dining experiences, cuisines, and geographical regions. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLMs with traditional machine learning approaches can effectively automate aspect-based sentiment analysis of large-scale customer feedback, suggesting a practical framework for both researchers and practitioners in the hospitality industry and potentially, other service sectors."}

Aphasia may impair the use and comprehension of written and spoken language. The Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R) is an assessment tool administered by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to evaluate the aphasia type and severity. Because the WAB-R measures isolated linguistic skills, there has been growing interest in the assessment of discourse production as a more holistic representation of everyday language abilities. Recent advancements in speech analysis focus on automated estimation of aphasia severity from spontaneous speech, relying mostly in isolated linguistic or acoustical features. In this work, we propose a graph neural network-based framework for estimating aphasia severity. We represented each participant's discourse as a directed multi-modal graph, where nodes represent lexical items and gestures and edges encode word-word, gesture-word, and word-gesture transitions. GraphSAGE is employed to learn participant-level embeddings, thus integrating information from immediate neighbors and overall graph structure. Our results suggest that aphasia severity is not encoded in isolated lexical distribution, but rather emerges from structured interactions between speech and gesture. The proposed architecture offers a reliable automated aphasia assessment, with possible uses in bedside screening and telehealth-based monitoring."}

In this work, we attribute the source of varying calibration parameters to the varying token-level sensitivity caused by a precision-dependent outlier migration phenomenon.Motivated by this observation, we propose \\texttt{MoBiQuant}, a novel Mixture-of-Bits quantization framework that adjusts weight precision for elastic LLM inference based on token sensitivity. Specifically, we propose the many-in-one recursive residual quantization that can iteratively reconstruct higher-precision weights and the token-aware router to dynamically select the number of residual bit slices. MoBiQuant enables smooth precision switching while improving generalization for the distribution of token outliers.

We developed RARE-PHENIX, an end-to-end AI framework for rare disease phenotyping that integrates large language model-based phenotype extraction, ontology-grounded standardization to HPO terms, and supervised ranking of diagnostically informative phenotypes. We trained RARE-PHENIX using data from 2,671 patients across 11 Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical sites, and externally validated it on 16,357 real-world clinical notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Ablation analyses demonstrated performance improvements with the addition of each module in RARE-PHENIX (extraction, standardization, and prioritization), supporting the value of modeling the full clinical phenotyping workflow.

In this work, we begin by directly comparing how the distribution of information stored across layers of attention heads differs between the protein and natural language domain. Furthermore, we adapt a simple early-exit technique-originally used in the natural language domain to improve efficiency at the cost of performance-to achieve both increased accuracy and substantial efficiency gains in protein non-structural property prediction by allowing the model to automatically select protein representations from the intermediate layers of the PLMs for the specific task and protein at hand.

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors.

Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations.

Preprint under review. Equal contribution by first two authors", "summary": "Post-training large foundation models with reinforcement learning typically relies on massive and heterogeneous datasets, making effective curriculum learning both critical and challenging. In this work, we propose ACTOR-CURATOR, a scalable and fully automated curriculum learning framework for reinforcement learning post-training of large language models (LLMs). ACTOR-CURATOR learns a neural curator that dynamically selects training problems from large problem banks by directly optimizing for expected policy performance improvement. We formulate problem selection as a non-stationary stochastic bandit problem, derive a principled loss function based on online stochastic mirror descent, and establish regret guarantees under partial feedback. Empirically, ACTOR-CURATOR consistently outperforms uniform sampling and strong curriculum baselines across a wide range of challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved training stability and efficiency. Notably, it achieves relative gains of 28.6% on AIME2024 and 30.5% on ARC-1D over the strongest baseline and up to 80% speedup. These results suggest that ACTOR-CURATOR is a powerful and practical approach for scalable LLM post-training."}

We focus on document-grounded question answering with asymmetric context, where a single model serves as both tutor (with access to a relevant source document during training) and student (answering from the question alone at test time). Rather than assuming tutor correctness, we derive supervision online from tutor consensus by sampling multiple document-grounded reasoning traces and using agreement to gate learning. Conditioned on this reliability signal, we distill knowledge through full tutor reasoning trajectories (not just final answers), providing a dense and stable learning signal. Empirically, this consensus-gated trajectory distillation substantially improves transfer to the document-free student. Held-out in-domain accuracy under asymmetric evaluation improves from 46.0\\% to 62.0\\%, and average (maj@8) accuracy on public document-free math benchmarks improves from 20.2\\% to 35.4\\%."}

But well-known problems with CoT faithfulness severely limit what insights can be gained from this practice. In this paper, we introduce a training method called Counterfactual Simulation Training (CST), which aims to improve CoT faithfulness by rewarding CoTs that enable a simulator to accurately predict a model's outputs over counterfactual inputs. We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST. These results suggest that CST can improve CoT faithfulness in general, with promising applications for CoT monitoring.

In MRI studies of brain tumors, however, we often involve multi-parametric scans and substructures. Here, fine-grained modality/parameter-wise reports are usually provided along with global findings and are correlated with different substructures. Moreover, the reports often describe only the largest lesion and provide qualitative or uncertain cues (``mild,'' ``possible''). Classical RSuper losses (e.g., sum volume consistency) can over-constrain or hallucinate unreported findings under such incompleteness, and are unable to utilize these hierarchical findings or exploit the priors of varied lesion types in a merged dataset. We explicitly parse the global quantitative and modality-wise qualitative findings and introduce a unified, one-sided, uncertainty-aware formulation (MS-RSuper) that: (i) aligns modality-specific qualitative cues (e.g., T1c enhancement, FLAIR edema) with their corresponding substructures using existence and absence losses; (ii) enforces one-sided lower-bounds for partial quantitative cues (e.g., largest lesion size, minimal multiplicity); and (iii) adds extra- vs. intra-axial anatomical priors to respect cohort differences. Certainty tokens scale penalties; missing cues are down-weighted. On 1238 report-labeled BraTS-MET/MEN scans, our MS-RSuper largely outperforms both a sparsely-supervised baseline and a naive RSuper method."}

A key challenge is the train-serving discrepancy: pre-ranking models are trained only on exposed interactions, yet must score all recalled candidates -- including unexposed items -- during online serving. This mismatch not only induces severe sample selection bias but also degrades generalization, especially for long-tail content. Existing debiasing approaches typically rely on heuristics (e.g., negative sampling) or distillation from biased rankers, which either mislabel plausible unexposed items as negatives or propagate exposure bias into pseudo-labels. In this work, we propose Generative Pseudo-Labeling (GPL), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate unbiased, content-aware pseudo-labels for unexposed items, explicitly aligning the training distribution with the online serving space. By offline generating user-specific interest anchors and matching them with candidates in a frozen semantic space, GPL provides high-quality supervision without adding online latency. Deployed in a large-scale production system, GPL improves click-through rate by 3.07%, while significantly enhancing recommendation diversity and long-tail item discovery."}

However, current evaluation benchmarks do not adequately assess their ability to solve real-world tasks that require synthesizing information from multiple sources and inferring insights beyond simple fact retrieval. To address this, we introduce DEEPSYNTH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agents on realistic, time-consuming problems that combine information gathering, synthesis, and structured reasoning to produce insights. DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries. DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers. When evaluated on DEEPSYNTH, 11 state-of-the-art LLMs and deep research agents achieve a maximum F1 score of 8.97 and 17.5 on the LLM-judge metric, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark. Our analysis reveals that current agents struggle with hallucinations and reasoning over large information spaces, highlighting DEEPSYNTH as a crucial benchmark for guiding future research."}

Drawing upon human reflective practitioners, we introduce Reflective Test-Time Planning, which integrates two modes of reflection: \\textit{reflection-in-action}, where the agent uses test-time scaling to generate and score multiple candidate actions using internal reflections before execution; and \\textit{reflection-on-action}, which uses test-time training to update both its internal reflection model and its action policy based on external reflections after execution. We also include retrospective reflection, allowing the agent to re-evaluate earlier decisions and perform model updates with hindsight for proper long-horizon credit assignment. Experiments on our newly-designed Long-Horizon Household benchmark and MuJoCo Cupboard Fitting benchmark show significant gains over baseline models, with ablative studies validating the complementary roles of reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action. Qualitative analyses, including real-robot trials, highlight behavioral correction through reflection."}

Late interaction has emerged as a dominant paradigm for information retrieval in text, images, visual documents, and videos, but its computation and storage costs grow linearly with document length, making it costly for image-, video-, and audio-rich corpora. To address this limitation, we explore query-agnostic methods for compressing multi-vector document representations under a constant vector budget. We introduce four approaches for index compression: sequence resizing, memory tokens, hierarchical pooling, and a novel attention-guided clustering (AGC). AGC uses an attention-guided mechanism to identify the most semantically salient regions of a document as cluster centroids and to weight token aggregation. Evaluating these methods on retrieval tasks spanning text (BEIR), visual-document (ViDoRe), and video (MSR-VTT, MultiVENT 2.0), we show that attention-guided clustering consistently outperforms other parameterized compression methods (sequence resizing and memory tokens), provides greater flexibility in index size than non-parametric hierarchical clustering, and achieves competitive or improved performance compared to a full, uncompressed index.
